### 🚀 **BOOTSTRAP FIRST: One-Time Project Setup** ⭐

**IMPORTANT**: You must bootstrap the agent system once for every new repo/project before using Claude 007 Agents.

```bash
# 1. Clone the system
git clone https://github.com/avivl/claude-007-agents.git
cd claude-007-agents

# 2. Copy to your project (any project)
cp -r .claude/agents /path/to/your/project/.claude/
cp agents.json /path/to/your/project/

# 3. BOOTSTRAP your project (REQUIRED - once per project)
cd /path/to/your/project
claude "Use @bootstrap-orchestrator to analyze and setup this project"

# 4. Start development immediately
claude "Use @software-engineering-expert to begin development"
```

#### What Bootstrap Does:
- 🔍 **Analyzes your codebase** (tech stack, architecture, complexity)  
- 🎯 **Selects optimal agents** based on your technology stack
- ⚙️ **Creates CLAUDE.md** with proper agent configuration and commit attribution
- 📋 **Sets up Task Master** integration (if desired)
- 🔗 **Configures MCP servers** for enhanced capabilities
- ✅ **Validates complete system** readiness

#### Bootstrap Works With:
